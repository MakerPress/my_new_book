You need to learn math to make better stuff.

New creative fields like computer vision, generative graphics, data visualization, and 3d printing are hitting a plateau where they require more and more mathematical knowledge to do interesting work. Increasingly, these fields are becoming the bases of art and design. We've known for awhile know that programming is a vital part of art and design practice and we've increasingly figured out how to teach programming to artists and designers. However the advent of these new areas are drawing in math that's more advanced than your run-of-the-mill trigonometry and 2D geometry. Topics like like linear algebra, topology, graph theory, differential equations (and I'm sure many others that you can rattle off more easily than I) are becoming central both to doing daily work in these fields and, more importantly, to inventing, popularizing, and teaching the new creative tools that are rapidly arising.

So, I want to do something about this. I want to figure out a way to teach myself and others these more advanced mathematical concepts with a specific eye towards applying them in creative technology. For example, I want to be able to read SIGGRAPH papers, understand what's going on in them, explain that to others, and create software libraries that implement their techniques. I want my peers who do data visualization to be able to implement regressions, curve fitting, statistical analysis and machine learning so that their projects are more than just pretty graphs with good typography that mean nothing. I want the hardware hackers who are building the next generation of DIY 3D printers to be able to turn topological algorithms and concepts into open source tool path generation software that creates more efficient gcode and enables the fabrication of previously impossible physical forms.

I'm not sure of the best way to go about this. I want to create some kind of community that's dedicated to working on these goals. Maybe a wiki or collaborative blog where we work through dissecting and annotating journal papers and explaining basic techniques. I want this community to include people from these "maker" disciplines as well as many real mathematicians as I can wrangle. I feel like my greatest advantage in this effort is that I am the target audience. I'm throwing myself into learning this material as hard as I can. Hopefully I can convince some others to come along with me.
